# Language

Giveaway Boat supports multiple languages for ease-of-use.
The only noticeable change will be in the bot's command responses. This does not affect the dashboard.

The languages supported includes:

- English
- Deutsch
- Español
- Français
- Indonesia

## Setup

In the dashboard "Settings" tab, select the "Giveaway Creator Roles" option and then select the new language from the opened dropdown menu.

After saving, you can notice the changes by using the `g.ping` command:
