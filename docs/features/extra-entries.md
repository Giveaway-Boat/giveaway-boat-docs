# Extra Entries

This option allows you to give select roles more chance on winning a giveaway. By default, people have a 100% / (amount of participants) chance of winning. But if extra entries for the role is set to 2, then they have a 200% / (amount of participants) chance of winning.

Description: These are the entries that the selected roles will get in this giveaway. You can give anywhere between 1 to 100 entries (or 250 entries if you have premium) to a role. By default, all roles are given 1 entry, so you don't have to set a role's entry to 1!
